# Project Outline

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a production-grade cloud-native DevOps platform that simulates real-world software delivery and operational workflows.

This platform will be built using a microservices-based architecture deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling of application components.

The project is designed to demonstrate the complete DevOps lifecycle, encompassing planning, application development, containerization, deployment, and continuous monitoring. Each phase of the lifecycle will be implemented using industry-standard tools and practices to reflect how modern engineering teams build and operate distributed systems.

Infrastructure provisioning will be fully automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, ensuring consistent and repeatable environment setup. A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be implemented to automate the process of building, testing, and packaging applications into container images.

Deployment to the Kubernetes environment will follow a GitOps-based approach, where the desired system state is defined declaratively in a version-controlled repository and automatically synchronized with the cluster using a GitOps tool.

To ensure system reliability and performance visibility, observability practices will be incorporated, including centralized monitoring and logging. These will provide insights into application health, resource utilization, and system behavior under different conditions.

## DevOps Lifecycle Scope

This project explicitly implements the following lifecycle phases:

- **Plan**: Define system architecture, components, and infrastructure design  
- **Build**: Develop microservices and application components  
- **Containerize**: Package applications into container images using Docker  
- **Deploy**: Deploy services to Kubernetes using CI/CD and GitOps workflows  
- **Monitor**: Observe system performance using monitoring and logging tools

## Core Capabilities

The platform will demonstrate the following DevOps capabilities:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated cloud resource provisioning  
- CI/CD pipeline automation for application build and deployment  
- Kubernetes-based orchestration for containerized workloads  
- GitOps workflow for declarative and automated deployments  
- Observability through monitoring and centralized logging  

---

## In Scope

The project will include:

- A Kubernetes-based microservices architecture  
- Multiple independently deployable services  
- Automated infrastructure provisioning  
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline implementation  
- GitOps-based deployment using a configuration repository  
- Monitoring and logging for both infrastructure and applications  

---

## Out of Scope

The project will not focus on:

- Complex business logic or domain-specific features  
- Production-grade security hardening  
- High-scale traffic simulation or performance optimization  
- Multi-region or multi-cloud deployments  

---

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

- Microservices are successfully deployed and accessible within the Kubernetes cluster  
- Infrastructure is provisioned entirely through code without manual setup  
- CI/CD pipelines automatically build and deploy application updates  
- GitOps workflow maintains synchronization between declared and actual system state  
- Monitoring dashboards display system metrics and health indicators  
- Logs are centralized and accessible for analysis  

---

## Alignment with Deliverables

This objective directly supports subsequent project deliverables, including:

- System architecture design  
- Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform  
- Microservices development and containerization  
- CI/CD pipeline implementation  
- GitOps deployment configuration  
- Observability and monitoring setup
